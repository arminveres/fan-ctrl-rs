# fan-ctrl-rs

An extremely simple application to control a PWM fan.
Even under full load, keeps the RPi below 60 ÂºC!

## Requirements

First of all PWM needs to be enabled on the RPi:

Add `dtoverlay=pwm,pin=18,func=2` (pwm/pwm-2chan docs) to `/boot/config.txt` to enable PWM Channel 0 on PIN 18.

Unsure, if it needs to be done once or if setup by RPPAL but I prompted the creation of `pwm0` by
running as sudo
```bash
echo 0 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
```

## TODOs

- [ ] Add support for other pins (currently Pin 18 is used)
- [ ] Add customizable fan curve
- [ ] Add TACH support, measuring incoming fan speed.
